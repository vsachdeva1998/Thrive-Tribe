        </ul>

        <h2>8. Termination</h2>
        <p>Either Party may terminate the Agreement and all Exhibits without cause with thirty (30) days' written notice. Upon termination, both Parties will return or destroy Confidential Information and certify such action within thirty (30) days.</p>
